8.1  Truck packing

 -- pack the largest boxes in first, with smaller boxes on and around the larger ones as you progress

8.2  Travel problem

 -- go to those locations that are of the highest point value, that are nearest to each other 

Are the following greedy?
8.3  Quicksort - not greedy; does not care about most optimal solution
8.4  Breadth-first search - greedy - greedy in terms of finding the shortest distance
8.5  Dijkstra - greedy -- looks for the highest point value first

8.6 A postman needs to deliver to 20 homes. He needs to find the
shortest route that goes to all 20 homes. Is this an NP-complete
problem?

-- yes; there are 20! possible routes 

8.7 Finding the largest clique in a set of people (a clique is a set of people
who all know each other). Is this an NP-complete problem?

-- yes; you would have to effectively ask everyone whom they were friends with

8.8 Youâ€™re making a map of the USA, and you need to color adjacent
states with different colors. You have to find the minimum number
of colors you need so that no two adjacent states are the same color.
Is this an NP-complete problem?

-- no; this is done very often, plus there is only a small set of possibilities one is dealing with ***????

What are approximation algorithms?
 - Approximation algorithms are used to find approximate solutions to problems.  They are often used to find reasonable solutions to NP-complete problems, where the 
precise solution may not be reached in a sane period of time.  

What defines a greedy stategy?
 - A greedy strategy is finding the most optimal route or solution.

9.1 should you steal the $1000 player?

-- Yes, as the ipod, mp3 player, and guitar would net $4500

9.2
 -- water, food, camera

What is dynamic programming?
 - Dyanimc programming is a form of programming where a large problem is broken down into smaller subproblems to be solved.  

When is it an appropriate solution?
 - When one is comparing words or options to see how they are similar or which is the most optimal.
