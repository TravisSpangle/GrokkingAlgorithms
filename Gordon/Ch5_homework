Q1: We've all taken our tools for granted. 
Research what algorithm your language of choice uses for generic sorts. 

A1: Oracle docs, “The sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithm 
that is fast (guaranteed nlogn) and stable (doesn’t reorder equal elements, important 
when sorting repeatedly on different attributes, like with your email inbox.)” 

Q2: Write a divide & conquer sort algorithm; quicksort, mergesort, or a homegrown 
solution you've used in production.  
A2: See Ch5_QuickSort file. 

Q3: Write an application that loads User Data and returns the Users by Zip. For example, LookUp.Zip('10011') returns the users Willow, Jose, & Layla.
A3: See UserData_App file.
